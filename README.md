### Background

Peeple Vs. Sheeple is a "would you rather" style game made using the angular 8. It utilizes a database for questions and players as well as two web-API's for faces and advice. It was created as a final project for a front-end bootcamp as part of Grand Circus.

## Quick Pitch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.

##### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

###### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

###### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

###### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

###### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
