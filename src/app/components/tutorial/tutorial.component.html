  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <div id="description">
    <p>
      <span class="italic">Peeple vs. Sheeple</span> is all about choice. You
      choose who you want to play as, their name, and which of two scenarios
      you/they prefer. Will you end up as an individual that thinks like the
      peeple, or just one of the herd of sheeple?

      <!-- <p>
      Peeple Vs. Sheeple is simple: just choose whichever option you prefer.
      From the persona you'd like to play as, to the questions presented,
      everything is as simple as a click or tap. You play the way you want, and
      in the end find out if you're a unique person, or one of the sheeple.
